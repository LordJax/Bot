- Restructured storage on the bot:
> Now using a PostgreSQL database for storing user and guild information.
> Now using Redis for caching.

- Revamped help command, with categories and specific command info :^)
- You can now reset your emoji when using `g*emote`! (note: you won't regain your tokens :c)
- Matches will now say how many tokens you've won. Just so you know, you know?

- (Hopefully) Fixed the "playing" when not really playing bug.
- Fixed time formatting. The predicted time should now look right below.
- Fixed dollar sign and backslash not being usable in prefixes.
- Fixed in a match message giving the leave command.
- Fixed translations on the turn match handler.
- Fixed formatting on nth messages multiples of 10.

Enjoy! ~ deprilula28

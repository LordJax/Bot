- Tokens are now formatted fancily.
- Minesweeper (and perhaps future hybrid games) will now be multiplayer by default, requiring a reaction to be played alone.
- Help command now has a different category for tokens, which slots is also a part of.

- New game added: Uno!
You get 7 cards, which are DM'd to you. On each round, you can use a card.
If you have a card with the same color or number as the last color used, you can use it.
Otherwise, you'll have to draw two cards.

- Fixed the slots command's message.
Enjoy! ~ deprilula28

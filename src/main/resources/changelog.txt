- Slots token limit was removed! Go wild! You can also use `g*gamble all` to gamble it all in.
- You can now give someone tokens! `g*tokens give <person> <amount>`
- Tokens command now shows the amount of tokens each task/achievement grants you, and a link to the Tokens Guide.
- Achievements have been separated from the tokens command to `g*achievements`.
- Added the russian `ru_RU` translation by ipdan4ik#3389 and alexcancker#0135. Try it out with `g*lang ru_RU`.

- Fixed the setprefix description.

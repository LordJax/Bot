- I shall now send changelogs. Robots shall continue overpowering human's jobs. Oh sorry I'm not supposed to say that
You can also use `g*changelog` to see the latest changelog.

- You can now use an uppercase prefix! `G*` all the way!
- The website will now show changelogs for recurring users! Handy!
- The sidebar on the wiki page will now show the selected page.
- Added a change language dropdown in the footer of the website.

- Removed changing status because aparently that's against TOS...

- Minesweeper will now be properly translatable.

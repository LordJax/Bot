- Added aditional game modes!
You can play these by adding `mode=<mode>` to the end of a game command (example: `g*connect4 mode=reverse`)
These are the currently implemented modes:

\* Reverse `reverse` for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4, where if you match you're out of the game, and the last player wins.
\* House `house` for Minesweeper, where the number of the mines you dig doesn't count the bottom, left and right tiles.
\* Knight Paths `knightpaths` for Minesweeper, where the number of the mines you dig doesn't count the surrounding 8 tiles, but rather tiles in knight paths (chess knights :^)) from it.

- Fixed server count uploading.
- Fixed matches starting after 20 seconds with no players. Twice, may I add.
- Fixed rematch on single player games.

Earlier update because I'm gonna be away for a bit. Next update is next friday.
Enjoy! ~ deprilula28

- You can now mention users in commands with their ID or Name#Discrim.
- Added a message for invalid translations.
- Added a new RNG system that should be less repetitive.

- New game: Town, Country, River! `g*towncountryriver` or `g*tcr`
Each player is given a letter and theme in their round.
You have to send a word that starts with that letter and fits that theme in 15 seconds.
The player who other players voted best wins!

- Fixed invalid numbers with `g*baltop global page`.
- Fixed german language.
- Fixed some things not wanting to save for some reason.
Enjoy! ~ deprilula28

- Town Country River now says nothing when the game's over and can be played with reactions if you have them allowed.
- Modes are now selectable more easily.

*And well, you asked for a bugfixes update so here you go:*

- Minesweeper now has 6 bombs by default to have the same ratio as real minesweeper. (Fin considered this a bug, so..)
- Fixed values not saving sometimes.
- Fixed error message on invalid User IDs.
- Fixed HTML escaping on some quiz questions.
- Fixed a bug with matches when you don't give the bot message history.
- Fixed `g*ping` (blame Fin).
- Fixed microseconds unit to say the proper thing (blame Fin once more).
- Fixed multiplayer minesweeper not giving bombs to one player.
- Fixed emoji tile description in `g*help`.
- Fixed the bot tagging `@everyone` if you have that name.
- Fixed connect4 & tic tac toe win detection.

Weekend update cause why not
Enjoy! ~ deprilula28

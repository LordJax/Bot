- Restructured a lot of how the bot works:
> The website now runs on a different process, coded in node.js (Source: https://github.com/GamesROB/Website).
> Now using Redis for caching on the bot and the website end.
> Now using a PostgreSQL database for storing user and guild information.
These should mean a more stable, reliable and fast experience with the bot. In the beggining, these might be buggy, so expect a bunch of bug fixes before it's perfected.

- Fixed in a match message giving the leave command.
- Fixed translations on the turn match handler.
- Fixed formatting on nth messages multiples of 10.

Enjoy! ~ deprilula28

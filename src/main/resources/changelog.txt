- New game added: Uno!
You get 7 cards, which are DM'd to you. On each round, you can use a card.
If you have a card with the same color or number as the last color used, you can use it.
Otherwise, you'll have to draw two cards.

I will be improving this game in the future.

- Spanish language was added! `es_ES` by Bsc#1436
Try it out with `g*lang es_ES`

- UK English language was added! `en_UK` by Late Trender#3625
Try it out with `g*lang en_UK`

- Tokens are now formatted fancily.
- Quiz is now playable single player!
- Hybrid games (minesweeper and quiz) will now be multiplayer by default, requiring a reaction to be played alone.
- Help command now has a different category for tokens, which slots is also a part of. The message has been overhauled overall.
- The bot will now give you twice the amount of tokens during weekends, and the bot will now properly tell you the 12 hour cooldown.
- Languages have been updated and improved. I'm sure non english speakers will enjoy.

- Fixed the slots command's message.
- Fixed quiz overflowing.
Enjoy! ~ deprilula28

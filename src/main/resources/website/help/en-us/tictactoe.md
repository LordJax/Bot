TicTacToe is a simple and classic game where you try to make a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with your tiles.

## How To Play

- Each tile in the board has a corresponding letter, and if you can use that tile it will be shown in white with a blue background.
Send that letter in the chat, in lowercase (i.e. `a` not `A`) to put your tile there.
- Make a line to win!

## Settings

- Board Size (`boardSize`): The size of the board. 2 to 5, 3 by default.
- Connect Tiles (`connectTiles`): How many tiles should be needed to connect. 2 to 10, 3 by default.

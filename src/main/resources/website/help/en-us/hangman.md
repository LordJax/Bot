# Hangman
![Hangman Picture](/res/hangman.png)

Hangman is a guessing game. The first player chooses a word, and the others need to guess it letter by letter, with only 5 tries. If the tries end, the first player wins. Otherwise, the guessers win.

## How To Play

- As the first player, DM (private message) the bot with the word you want to pick.
- From there on, other players can try guessing a letter by putting it on the chat (lower cased, i.e. `a` not `A`).
- If the guessers can guess the word in 5 tries, they win. Otherwise, the first player will win.

## Settings

- Tries (`tries`): How many tries the guessers get. 1 to 16, 4 by default.
